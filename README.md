## Creating React app 

      npx create-react-app my-app

## Installation adding packages

### Send message directly to my email free access with limit 200 email per day. [Emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)
      npm install @emailjs/browser
      
### font-family: ‘poppins’ sans-serif in [Font](fonts.google.com)

### create any shape in css custom in [Shape](bennettfeely.com)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Deploy to firebase in [Server](firebase.google.com)
1. - Install Firebase Tools
We need to install firebase tools globally in the command prompt window.

    npm install -g firebase-tools
    
2. - Initialize the Firebase App
First we need to login to Firebase in the command prompt.

### `firebase login`
    
Open the root folder of your app in the command prompt and run the following command.

### `firebase init`
    
This command will initialize your app.

NOTE − If you have used a default configuration, the public folder will be created and the index.html inside this folder will be the starting point of your app. You can copy your app file inside the public folder as a workaround.

3. - Deploy Firebase App
This is the last step in this chapter. Run the following command from the command prompt to deploy your app.

### `firebase deploy`
    
After this step, the console will log your apps Firebase URL. In our case, it is called https://tutorialsfirebase.firebaseapp.com. We can run this link in the browser to see our app.

In the project directory, you can run:

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
